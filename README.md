# queueSystem
A college activity once but I actually liked the concept and started adding features! (currently learning mongodb to java)


*Changes will be logged here*
# VERSION 1.0
+ Now detects if the queue is empty and prompts the user whether they want to continue it or not.
+ Fixed the issue where users had to enter "R" twice in order to re-enter a name.

# VERSION 2.0
+ Added a time logging system
+ Fixed whenever the user is prompted with "Do you want to continue the program" entering a small letter gives an error
+ Optimized the code a bit

# VERSION 2.1
- Removed one line of code
